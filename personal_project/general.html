            <h4>Generalists are bears that tend to make the most of whatever situation they find themself in. 
                They are the bears that have that stereotypical life, they like honey, rummaging through garbage 
                and of course commit the long sleep known as hibernation.

            <h3 class="gen-black-p">Region: Western North America, Himalayas, Iran, Northern India, Korea, Eastern Russia, Japan, and Taiwan
                <br>Average Length: 160cm 
                <br>Average Weight: 118kg
                <br>Viability: Technically speaking the black bear has two predominant archetypes, the north American black bear and 
                the Asian black bear, however, their lifestyle and habitat are largely the same such I have categorized them as such. 
                Black bears are the true master of adaptability, being omnivores that can eat virtually anything for energy. They have 
                impeccable mobility and are the most agile of all the bears. They are notoriously great climbers and are very intelligent. 
                Though humans continue to push into their terrain, black bears continue to adapt and have even turned human trash into 
                treasure.

                <br>Rank: 10/10 
                <br>The actual best bear, they can do virtually anything they need to and a just the perfect bear.

            <h3 class="gen-brown-p"> Region: North America and Eurasia 
                <br>Average Length: 210cm 
                <br>Average Weight: 335kg
                <br>Viability: Brown bears are a physical powerhouse and are one of the strongest creatures in their environment, 
                they are also the most intelligent bear, and thanks to their intelligence they can put all that strength to good use. 
                The brown bear's main source of food is human trash and salmon. The brown bears' hunting of salmon is particularly ingenious 
                as they use the salmon-required migration period to net a great deal of fat storage to make the bears' hibernation stunningly 
                easy.

                Rank: 7/10 - 10/10 
                <br>Brown bears have many different styles, namely the grizzly or Kodiak, and depending on the style they are either some of the 
                best bears out there or they have just a few things they lack

            <h2 class="gen-andean-t">ANDEAN BEAR</h2>            
            <h3 class="gen-andean-p">Region: South American Andes
                <br>Average Length: 140cm 
                <br>Average Weight: 100kg
                <br>Viability: Andean bears are the largest predator in the Andes giving them a 
                unique place in the food chain. Though not quite apex predators, nothing in their 
                region can hunt them, making their life relatively safe. Andean bears also have 
                the largest size variations among the bears being able to be as small as 30kg and 
                as large as 150kg. They are arboreal specialists with the fast climb speed of all 
                the bears and insane vertical mobility. The only limiting factor to the Andean bear 
                is the region they find themselves in, relying on insects and birds to provide them 
                with fat for hibernation. This often results in not getting enough energy and instead 
                must hunt throughout the winter. 

                <br>Rank: 8/10 
                <br>Andean Bears is held back more by its environment than anything else but is all-around a fantastic bear
