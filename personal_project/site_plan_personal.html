    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://colorkit.co/color-palette-generator/d9d0b4-a98467-8097be-6c584c/"
      target="_blank">https://colorkit.co/color-palette-generator/d9d0b4-a98467-8097be-6c584c/</a>

        <th>#6c584c</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">##d9d0b4</td>
        <td class="secondary">#a98467</td>
        <td class="accent1">#8097be</td>
        <td class="accent2">#6c584c</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: Chewy
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Comfortaa
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      I like Bears, there are 8 kinds of bears. North American Black Bear, 
      Asiatic Black Bear, Brown Bear, Polar Bear, Panda Bear, Sun Bear, Sloth Bear, and Andean Bear.
      Though I love all bears, it is important to see how the compare to one another.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      While formitable creatures and very dangerous I have always been facinated by bears.
      I like all bears but I think it is time that someone decided offically which bear is best.
      I will do that, probably.

      Content
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      We will be ranking bears based exclusively on viability, which is to say how effective
      they are at living. We will consider multiple different aspects across all 8 types of 
      bears before assigning a score out of ten based on how viable I believe the bear to be.
      The main page will then have all eight bears and a smaller blurb about them along with 
      an image of each.
