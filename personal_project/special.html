                exceptionally well. They are the bears who break the mold and try 
                something, for better or worse, that nor many mammals try to do.

            <h3>Region: Southeast Asia
                <br>Average Length: 135cm 
                <br>Average Weight: 45kg
                <br>Viability: Sun bears rely on termites, ants, and other small insects for food. 
                Their long longs and flexible snouts make eating these bugs incredibly easy, they also
                 have short but razor-sharp claws that are excellent at getting into their prey colonies. 
                 They also have the largest canines of all bears, as they are not carnivorous they are mostly 
                 useless and only function as tools. Sun Bears are the smallest of all the bears by a pretty 
                 large margin and fall prey easily to the more dangerous predators of the South East Asian region. 
                 They do have a cuteness factor that can not be ignored, howver Sun Bears tend to avoid humans, 
                 therefore not fully capitalizing on their potential charisma

                <br>Overall Ranking 4/10
                <br>While being a tiny bear  is a novel, it makes them rather weak, and struggle to find a place in their environment.

            <h3>Region: Southwest China
                <br>Average Length: 150cm 
                <br>Average Weight: 113kg
                <br>Viability: Pandas are overly specialized relying solely on bamboo for their only source of food, this 
                limits where they can live pretty heavily, as well as limits their energy as bamboo is not the most nutritious 
                of foods The strict diet also makes hibernation impossible requiring pandas to be active in summer and winter. 
                Their famous black and white color scheme makes them adorable but provides no benefit to their lifestyle, instead 
                are a hindrance making them unable to use stealth whatsoever. Overall pandas are a fairly useless animal regarding 
                viability, however, they do have one thing going for them, they have very high charisma, making humans love them.

                <br>Rank: 2/10 or 10/10
                <br>The worst bear they struggle to surivve on there own and picked a horrible food, 
                However with the aid of humans, they are an easy perfect bear, due to their cuteness humans will stop at nothing to keep them alive.

            <h3>Region: India, Sri Lanka, and Southwest Nepal
                <br>Average Length: 165cm 
                <br>Average Weight: 100kg
                <br>Viability: Sloth Bears rely exclusively on insects for sustenance, they have specialized hook-like 
                claws that allow them to climb, or break trees and dig with ease, allowing for easy access to wasps and termites, 
                their main food source. Despite being a bear, sloth bears are prey to the more aggressive predators of their regions, 
                making their life rather difficult. Because of their climate, they also donâ€™t get to enter hibernation and thus have 
                to constantly be striving to survive

                <br>Rank: 5/10 
                <br>Sloth bears, despite being hyper specialized to eat bugs are average at best at it and while 
                not bad at anything they are not remarkable at anything either

        <section class = "polar">
            <img class = "card-img" src="images/polar_page2.jpeg" alt="polar bear image">
            <h3>Region: Arctic Circle, Northern Russia and Canada
                <br>Average Length: 240cm 
                <br>Average Weight: 525kg
                <br>Viability: Polar bears are on average the strongest of all the bears, with 
                incredible physical strength in all of their legs and a devastatingly strong bite. 
                Their size and aggression make them an imposing force and would dominate in most other biomes, 
                however being locked into the arctic puts their immense strength to little use as their most common prey, 
                seals, is one the few creatures able to survive a frontal assault, and are mobile enough in 
                the water that the polar bear is more reliant on stealth than any other bear, to successfully 
                capture a meal. Polar bears also do not hibernate and on the contrary use the colder winter months 
                to more successfully hunt as seals become more lethargic in the winter.

                <br>Overall Ranking 7/10
                <br>Being an arctic bear comes with too many drawbacks for them to live up to their potential. 
                if polar bears moved a little to the south they would become power houses in the bear family, 
                but for now sit just outside the upper echelon.
