        <h3 class="q1">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim!</h3>
        <h5 class="a1">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, 
                our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. 
                The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). 
                Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety 
                talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</h5>

        <h3 class="q3">What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h3>
        <h5 class="a3">Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river.
                        Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. 
                        Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and 
                        prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, 
                        geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can 
                        relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your 
                        dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...
                        you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to 
                        talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were 
                        possible.

        <h3 class="q4">Is this a good trip for kids?</h3>
        <h5 class="a4">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 
                seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). 
                A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. 
                Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the 
                most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids
                 which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river 
                 guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</h5>
