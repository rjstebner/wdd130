        <h3 class="q1">Is whitewater rafting safe?</h3>
        <h5 class="a1">All adventure sports have an inherent element of risk. To ensure your safety, 
                our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. 
                Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). 
                Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety 
                talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</h5>

        <h3 class="q2">What do I need to bring?</h3>
        <h5 class="a2">The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both 
            hot & dry and cold & wet. Layers that are quick dry and swimsuits are the best choice. Remember to bring a brimmed hat, 
            sunglasses, sandals or water shoes. It is a good idea to bring comfortable clothes to wear around camp and sleep wear. 
            Be sure to bring a water bottle, headlamp, sunscreen, and moleskin. You may also want to bring other items such as personal 
            hygiene kits (toothbrush and toothpaste, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, etc), spare glasses or contacts, 
            biodegradable soap and shampoo, camera equipment. Relaxation items such as a journal, watercolors, or a book may also be a 
            good idea.

        <h3 class="q3">What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h3>
        <h5 class="a3">Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...
            Let's describe an average day on the river. Wake up after a night under the stars to a 
            warm breakfast of blueberry pancakes or fresh omelets. After packing and preparing for the day its 
            time to start the adventure. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, 
            history, geology, stories, and more good food. Camp is set up in the late afternoon, with plenty of delicious options 
            for dinner and dessert. Enjoy the evening by relaxing and listening to a few good stories before falling asleep 
            under the stars

        <h3 class="q4">Is this a good trip for kids?</h3>
        <h5 class="a4">Absolutely! We have found however that children over the age of 8, and their parents, 
            seem to enjoy it more overall. While parents may be concerned with boredom during parts of the adventure 
            we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of 
            the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to 
            mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide 
            for stories and safety.
